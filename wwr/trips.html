                    <h2>Cotton Head River</h2>
                    <p>Cotton Head River is one of our favorite adventures to take people on.  It features
                        amazing scenery, with some medium intensity rapids, giving a taste of everything
                        you can find in our adventures.  This adventure usually takes half a day, but can run
                        faster after the spring rains.  We recommend planning this adventure for mid to late summer.

                    <h2>Rattle Snake Gorge</h2>
                    <p>Rattle Snake Gorge is the perfect adventure for thrill-seekers.  It features long stretches of
                        of fast flowing rapids.  This adventure is also a great introduction to some of the more
                        technical aspects of white water rafting, such as collision avoidance, capsizing prevention,
                        and portage.  This adventure typically takes a few hours, and is only available in the spring
                        and early summer while the water runs high.

                    <h2>Devil's Run</h2>
                    <p>Devil's Run is a stretch of river, just above Rattle Snake Gorge, that features many difficult
                        to navigate rapids, offering a challenging adventure for experienced white water rafters.  We've
                        spent years learning the ins and outs of this section of river, and haven't found a better place
                        for a group of experienced rafters to build their relationships through intense teamwork.  Due to
                        its placement just above Rattle Snake Gorge, many adventurers make an all day trip of Devil's Run,
                        lunch, then Rattle Snake Gorge.

                    <h2>Jeremy's Canyon</h2>
                    <p>Jeremy's Canyon is a fun, relaxing adventure through multiple slot canyons.  We don't know who
                        Jeremy was, but he must have been a pretty chill dude.  These slot canyons give an unique peek
                        into the geological past of the area.  We're no historians, but we've learned a thing or two
                        about the different rocks, fossils, and other deposits revealed in the canyon walls.  Paired
                        with a lunch at the end, this makes for a fun and educational half-day trip.

                    <h2>Serenity's Ford</h2>
                    <p>
                        Serenity's Ford is a peaceful stretch of river at the end of Jeremy's Canyon.  It's often compared
                        to a Lazy River's big brothers.  This is a common part of the river to see people floating down due
                        to its slower pace and lack of rapids.  This is a great adventure for families with children who
                        may not be able to handle navigating rapids (or struggle to avoid jumping in the water).  On its own,
                        Serenity's Ford takes a couple of hours to flow through, however when paired with Jeremy's Canyon and
                        lunch, this makes for a relaxing all day trip.
