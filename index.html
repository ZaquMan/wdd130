                Hello!  I'm Zach.  I have been in the IT field for over 5 years, but have always wanted to move over to program development.  While some of
                my roles have given me opportunities towards this, it's come time for me to get a degree to back this up.  So, here I am.  Since I am mostly
                self taught, I look forward to strengthening my foundational knowledge so that I can become a better developer.

                    California is home to Hollywood and fires.  Whenever you hear about a large forest fire on the news (in the USA), it's probably in California
                    somewhere.  California is so large that it could be two or three states, has multiple climates, and takes around 14 hours to drive from top to bottom.
