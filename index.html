                Hello!  I'm Zach.  I have been in the IT field for over 5 years, but have always wanted to move over to program development.  While some of
                my roles have given me opportunities towards this, it's come time for me to get a degree to back this up.  So, here I am.  Since I am mostly
                self taught, I look forward to strengthening my foundational knowledge so that I can become a better developer.
